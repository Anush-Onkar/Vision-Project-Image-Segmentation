# Vision-Project-Image-Segmentation

## Project Submission by Anush Onkarapa (7010620- anon00001@stud.uni-saarland.de) & Hitesh Kotte (7010571-hiko00001@stud.uni-saarland.de)

###Task1
Solution of the Task1 is in the file Vision_task1_solution.ipynb, we have used VGG-16 pretrained model for the task1 on PascalVoc 2012 Dataset. 

###Task2
Solution for the Task2 are in the scripts main_task2, evalaution,R2_Unet_model and Metrics which includes training, evaluation metrics.
R2U-net has been implemented in the task as per the paper https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.06955.pdf on CityScape dataset.


###Task3

Solution for the Task3 are in the scripts main_task3, evalaution,Atten_R2_Unet_model and Metrics which includes training, evaluation metrics.
An Aattemp has been made to implement Attention R2U-net for purpose trying to improve the model R2Unet implemented in the paper https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.06955.pdf on CityScape dataset.
